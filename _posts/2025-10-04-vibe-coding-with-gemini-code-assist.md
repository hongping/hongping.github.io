I’ve been thinking a lot about [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) and finally decided to give it a proper shot. I’ve toying with it on and off before, but never really finished a project. This past week, though, FOMO kicked in — so I committed to it, carving out just 20 minutes a day to see what would happen.

First question: _what to create?_ I opted for something simple — a game. Pong felt perfect: it’s classic, visual, and achievable within small daily sessions. Plus, coding it in JavaScript meant I could host it for free on GitHub Pages and share it easily.

There’s also another reason for picking JavaScript: it’s one of the most common languages, and I’m pretty confident most LLMs are well-trained with it. That makes the back-and-forth with an AI smoother.

As for the AI, I went with **Gemini Code Assist**. The main factor? It’s free, and Google is generous with the quotas:

*   **60 requests per minute**
    
*   **1000 requests per day**
    
*   A **1 million token context window** for local code base
    

That’s plenty of room for vibe coding experiments without worrying about hitting limits.

Next, get started! I am not really fluent in Javascript - I can read and understand, but to start something from scratch with it, is near impossible for me.
