I was curious when Google announced Antigravity, mostly because I wasn’t sure what it was trying to be. After giving it a try, it became clear it’s not a “vibe coding” tool, and it’s not a typical Copilot-style editor either. It feels more like an agent-driven IDE. You don’t sit there typing line after line of code. You operate more like a program manager: laying out requirements, reviewing the agent’s proposed plan, clarifying its questions, and firing back your own to tighten the design before anything gets executed. It’s essentially a spec-driven development workflow baked right into the environment.
