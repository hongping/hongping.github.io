Hi, I'm Hong Ping - a technologist with a deep passion for building, exploring, and understanding the world of hardware and software.

My journey has always been rooted in semiconductors, IP, and SoC design and verification, but I'm equally fascinated by the fast-moving world of software development and the ways it connects with hardware. Whether it's verification, architecture, or system-level design, I enjoy digging into complex problems and sharing insights that can help others navigate them.

Beyond hardware, I keep a close eye on the latest trends in AI, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs). The intersection of these technologies with semiconductor development excites me the most - it's where innovation is happening at an incredible pace.

On this blog, you'll find my thoughts, experiences, and explorations across:
- Hardware design, IP, and SoC insights
- Verification methodologies and best practices
- Programming and software development
- Technology shifts in AI/ML and beyond

At the core, I believe in continuous learning and in connecting dots between domains - because hardware and software aren't separate worlds anymore; they're deeply intertwined.

If you share the same curiosity about how technology evolves, or if you're just looking for professional insights with a practical angle, you'll feel right at home here.
